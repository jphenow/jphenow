# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jon Phenow! I live in my favorite city (Minneapolis, MN) with my wife Steph, our dog Nova, and our cat Gus. When I'm not Software Engineering I'm playing hockey, biking, at to the cabin ([Up North](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OT684hsC7U)), playing video games, watching soccer, among arguably too many other things.
