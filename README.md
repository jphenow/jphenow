# Hi there 👋

I'm Jon Phenow! I live in my favorite city (Minneapolis, MN) with my wife Steph, our dog Nova, and our cat Gus. When I'm not Software Engineering I play hockey, go to the cabin ([Up North](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OT684hsC7U)), play video games, watching soccer among arguably too many other things.
